    "video_script": "Passive income represents a financial stream that requires little to no daily effort to maintain, unlike traditional active income from salaries or wages which depend directly on hours worked. It often involves an initial investment of time, money, or both, to set up a system that generates revenue automatically or with very minimal upkeep, such as earnings from rental properties, stock dividends, royalties from creative works, or profits from an automated online business, providing financial freedom and flexibility.",
